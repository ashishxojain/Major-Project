# CASCADE: A Scalable Open-Source CI/CD Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview

**CASCADE** (Continuous Automation System for Code Analysis, Deployment & Evaluation) is an end-to-end CI/CD solution built entirely on **open-source technologies**. Designed to streamline the software delivery lifecycle, CASCADE integrates tools like **Jenkins**, **SonarQube**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Prometheus/Grafana**, and **Trivy** to offer a secure, efficient, and cost-effective development pipeline.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins
- Static code analysis and quality gates with SonarQube
- Secure containerization with Trivy and Docker
- Scalable deployments on Kubernetes
- Real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Automated email notifications for build status
- Plagiarism detection integration for academic use cases
- Support for Java, Node.js, and Python applications

```


## 📧 Email Notifications

- Jenkins sends HTML-formatted emails on build success/failure.
- Includes job name, build number, status, timestamp, and clickable build link.
- Configured using the `emailext` plugin and Gmail SMTP.

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- 🔐 **Token-based access** for GitHub, Docker, and SonarQube
- 🔐 **TLS encryption** for data-in-transit
- 🔐 **Role-based access control (RBAC)** in Kubernetes
- 🔐 **Secret scanning** using Trivy

---

## 📈 Monitoring and Logging

- 📊 **Grafana Dashboards** visualize real-time CPU, memory, disk, and traffic metrics.
- 🔎 **Prometheus** scrapes metrics from running services.
- 🔍 **Blackbox Exporter** ensures service uptime and endpoint health.
- 📦 (Optional) Integration with ELK Stack for log aggregation.

---

## 🧪 Test Automation

- Unit tests included for Java, Node.js, and Python projects
- Tests integrated within pipeline stages
- Coverage reports managed via SonarQube

---

## 🧠 Intelligent Features

- 🚨 Vulnerability alerts via Trivy (FS and image scans)
- ✅ Quality gate enforcement using SonarQube
- 📩 Automated Slack/email reports for builds and scans
- 🔁 Smart pipeline branching based on detected tech stack (Node, Java, Python)

---

## 📜 Plagiarism Reporting (Academic Context)

- Java-based detection integrated
- Scans LDAP scripts and unit tests for duplication
- Generates HTML report using diff tools or third-party analyzers

---

## 💻 Project Compatibility

- ✅ Java 11 (Maven)
- ✅ Node.js 18
- ✅ Python 2.7 & 3.x
- 🐳 Compatible with Docker and K8s clusters
- 🌐 GitHub for version control

---

## 🗃️ Future Enhancements

- Integrate GitOps (e.g., ArgoCD or FluxCD)
- Add AI-based test case generation
- Enhance RBAC for multi-tenant environments
- Connect ELK for full observability
